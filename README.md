# BASE-Code
BASE-Code is a programming language made to fix the problems in most programming languaages. 
# What's Special about it
It:
  - automatically manages memory
  - can run even when the program has errors
  - automatically figures out the type of variables
  - allows the programmer to add custom pointers to the pointer stack (Go Stack)
  - automatically figures out when the function should finish
  - minimizes keywords
  - globalizes all variables in the code
  - Makes all variables dictionaries
  - Doesn't come with lists
  - Doesn't have classes
  - Uses Go commands to control the command flow
  - Doesn't check for syntax errors untill it has to run that section, and adds filler content to make the code still work
  - Uses Polish Notation to know what commands to run before getting data for it
  - Doesn't use tabs as syntax
