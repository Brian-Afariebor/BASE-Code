# BASE-Code
When I started learning how to program, I started out with Python. It was great, but there weren't that many uses for it. Then I started learning C, but I hated memory management and pointers to data. However, I had loved the idea of a programming language somewhat beased on a Turing Machine. As a result, I created BASE-Code.

# How to use BASE-Code
To learn how to write in BASE-Code, look at the Tuturial Files. To execute a program, download the Rust BASE-Code Interpreter file. Then, make a text file with the code you want to run. After this, paste in the path to the text file, and let it run.
