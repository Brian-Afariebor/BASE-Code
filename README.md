# BASE-Code
BASE-Code is a programming language made to fix the problems in most programming languaages. It:
  - automatically manages memory
  - can run even when the program has errors & tries to tell the programmer what is wrong clearly (instead of saying things like "Long_File_Name can't open Long_File_Name [Erno 2] No such file or directory" without clearly saying what can be done to fix the issue)
  - automatically figures out the type of variables
  - allows the programmer to add custom pointers to the pointer stack (Go Stack)
  - automatically figures out when the function is finished (no using things like semi-colons)
  - minimizes keywords (no public static void main)
  - globalizes all variables in the code
